            <h2>Average CO2 Emissions by State in Australia</h2>
            <div id="map1"></div>
            <p>The map above provides a visual representation of the average CO2 emissions for each Australian state. It highlights the variation in emissions across different regions, with Queensland and New South Wales standing out as the states with the highest average emissions. In contrast, states such as Tasmania and the Northern Territory show much lower average CO2 emissions, likely reflecting differences in population density, industrial activity, and energy use.</p>

        <!-- Second Row: Multi-line chart -->
        <div class="pure-u-1 vis-container">
            <h2>Aggregated CO2 Emission Trends by State</h2>
            <div class="pure-u-1" id="map2"></div>
            <p>The Aggregated CO2 Emission Trends by State shows that states like Queensland (QLD) and New South Wales (NSW) have historically contributed the most to CO2 emissions, though there has been a recent decline. Smaller states such as the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) and Tasmania (TAS) have consistently low emissions.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Third Row: Stacked area chart -->
        <div class="pure-u-1 vis-container">
            <h2>Cumulative CO2 Emissions by State Over Time</h2>
            <div class="pure-u-1" id="map3"></div>
            <p>The Cumulative CO2 Emissions highlights the dominant contributions of QLD and NSW to national emissions. The overall trend shows stabilization in emissions, suggesting progress toward reducing environmental impact, especially in higher-emitting states.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Fourth Row: Radial and Butterfly chart side by side -->
        <div class="pure-u-1 vis-container">
            <h2>Average Emissions Breakdown and Comparison</h2>
            <div class="pure-u-1-2" id="map4"></div>
            <div class="pure-u-1-2" id="map6"></div>
            <p>The pie chart shows that Energy Emissions dominate, contributing nearly 48 kt of CO2 on average, while other sources like industrial, land use, and waste emissions are smaller.<br>
                The butterfly chart highlights that NSW and QLD have the highest energy emissions, largely due to their large populations, industrial activity, and reliance on coal-fired power plants. Industrial emissions are generally lower, but NSW remains a leading contributor in both categories, highlighting areas for targeted emission reductions.
            </p>

        <!-- Fifth Row: Scatterplot and paragraph beside it -->
        <div class="pure-u-1 vis-container">
            <h2>GSP vs CO2 Emissions by State</h2>
            <div class="pure-u-1-2" id="map5"></div>
            <p class="pure-u-1-2">The scatterplot above compares Gross State Product (GSP) with CO2 emissions for different Australian states. It shows a clear positive correlation between economic output (GSP) and CO2 emissions. States with higher GSP, like Queensland (QLD), New South Wales (NSW), and Victoria (VIC), tend to have higher emissions, reflecting the industrial and economic activities driving both production and pollution.<br>
                Smaller states such as Tasmania (TAS) and the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) cluster at the lower end of both GSP and emissions, indicating that economic scale and emissions output are closely tied. This scatterplot can help identify the relationship between economic growth and environmental impact, suggesting the need for cleaner, sustainable growth strategies in high-emitting states.
